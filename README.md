# MiningCodingDojo

This project allows to create a Coding Dojo that allows the participants to improve their skills building resilient applications 
## Introduction

The exercise consisted in mine as fast as possible in a gold mine. You need to mine fast because the gold mine had limited resources so if you mine faster than your competitors you will win... or not because the API fails randomly.

To get your gold you need:

* Create your miner
* Log in into the mine
* Get your identification number
* Collect Gold using your identification number
* Save your gold in your pocket ;)

To access to all the endpoints just run [host]/swagger

The kata can be done in 45'
